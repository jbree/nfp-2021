## Rules

### Summary

Teams are chosen before the first game of the NFL season and points are awarded for victories throughout the year–regular season and playoffs.

The player with the most points after the Super Bowl is the winner.

Sounds simple...and it is. Simple to play...not so simple to win.

### Players:
- 8 players are optimal for the NFL Family Pool
- Each player ends up with 4 teams and all teams are chosen

### Drafting Teams:
- Teams are chosen through a draft system
- There are 4 rounds in the draft with each player drafting one team per round
- A team can be drafted only one time - once drafted, they are off the board
- The draft order is determined prior to the beginning of the draft - from 1st to 8th
- The draft order can be determined in any way deemed fair by the players
  - For the NFL Family Pool, the draft order is determined using a draw of cards - Ace through 8
- Round 1 of the draft follows the draft order
- For Round 2, the draft order is reversed so that the player that drafts last in round 1 then drafts first in round 2
  - This results in the same player drafting 2 teams in a row - the 8th and 9th picks
- For Round 3, the draft order reverts back to the original order
  - This results in the same player drafting 2 teams in a row - the 16th and 17th picks ​
- For Round 4, the draft order is reversed so that the player that drafts last in round 3 then drafts first in round 4
  - This results in the same player drafting 2 teams in a row - the 24th and 25th picks
- The last pick in the draft goes to the player that picked first overall in the draft


### Regular Season Points

- 1 point is earned for each win in the regular season
- No points are awarded for ties or losses
- Points are then multiplied by the round the team was drafted in...for example:
  - Teams drafted in Round 1 earn 1 point for each win
  - Teams drafted in Round 4 earn 4 points for each win
  - If a 1st Round team goes 16-0, it earns 16 points for the regular season
  - If a 4th Round team goes 10-6, it earns 40 points for the regular season
- 8 players are optimal for the NFL Family Pool
- Each player ends up with 4 teams and all teams are chosen

### Playoff Points:

- Division winners earn 8 points for winning their division
- Wild card teams earn 5 points for earning a wild card berth
- Teams earning a first round bye earn 4 additional points
- Teams winning in the Wild Card round earn 4 additional points
- Teams winning in the Divisional round and earning a berth in the Conference Championships earn 10 additional points
- Teams that play in the Super Bowl earn 10 additional points
- The Super Bowl Winner earns 10 additional points

### The Obvious:
- 4th round teams earn a lot of points in the regular season
- 1st Round teams make the playoffs much more frequently and have a chance to earn Playoff points
- You must draft well in each round to win the pool!
- Talented players against competent competition will do well to pick 2 teams that make the playoffs
- Picking 3 playoff teams is really hard

<br/>

- You can definitely win this pool even if you don't have the super bowl winner...but those 10 points really help when your 3rd round team lays an egg and goes 3-13 for only 9 points (3 x 3)
- When your teams play each other, you are guaranteed a win...and a loss...unless they tie...then you're screwed (obviously!)

<br/>

- Choosing 3 teams from the same division thinking you will corner the division, get lots of guaranteed wins and also end up with a great (75%) chance of picking the division winner is a strategy best left to the most "experienced" players
- Having 3 playoff teams is not a guarantee for winning this pool...check out the 2007 playoff results when a draft of Dallas, Seattle, Tennessee & Miami landed the player in no better than 5th place even though 3 of those teams made the playoffs with 13, 10 and 10 wins respectively
- Speaking of that 2007 draft, none of those teams made the conference championships and Miami "shat" the bed with a 1-15 season returning only 4 points from the ever-so-important 4th round...loser!

<br/>

- This is a great pool...try it out...you'll see...I guarantee it...<em>or double your money back!!!</em>
- Call your friends and get started!
